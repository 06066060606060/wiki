# Kiosk Mode

The Xbox One family of consoles features an obscure mode of operation called `Kiosk Mode`. This mode was and is still used to this day to turn the console into a secure multimedia device to be used at retail stores.

## Exploits

Presumably, an exploit in Kiosk mode allowed to mount any XVD in the console and browse its contents. However, it has not been possible to reproduce this behaviour, even when trying with old consoles. If you have information about this exploit or similar techniques, please get in contact.
